# EMMA

This project is a reimplementation of the [vue-based prototype](https://github.com/floriankrueger/emma-buddy) created by the EMMA Buddy team during the #wirvsvirus hackathon. 

Since the project itself has been retired I'm just publishing it here in case anyone might be interested.

## Demo 

Currently, there is a demo instance live on firebase, that you can check out: https://emma-buddys.web.app/ (I'm not sure how long this will be around though).

## Instructions

If you're interested in using this code, feel free to do so. Just get in touch and I'll be happy to help you with any questions!
